## Goal

In this competition, participants are expected to design a system to provide early warning signals of potential corporate vulnerabilities. 


## Data

All  teams are expected  to make full use of the computing environment provided by the competition organizer. 

All data is  stored in the ~/desktop  or /user directory of the virtual machine in the competition environment. 

There are two folders in this directory. 

In particular,  Folder * *online Data* *  provides the entire data for this competition. Due to the data copyright, it is prohibited to downloaded the entire dataset  to  personal computers.

However, to assist the implementation and deployment, Folder * *Sample for Download* * provides a portion of the data for each team to download. 

Participants are encouraged to use this sample data  for offline programming and testing. However, the final prototype and performance evaluation task have to be implemented and deployed  online in the competition environment. 

The data of this competition can only be used for this year's FINTECH80-CHENGDU.  Proliferation, copying or any other use from the virtual machine is prohibited. The operation of the virtual machine will be audited.

We offer to download the sample data from S3 (login authorization required ), the download will valid right after the launch of FINTECH80 competition.
